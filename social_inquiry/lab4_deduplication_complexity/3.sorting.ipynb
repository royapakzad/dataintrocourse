Sometimes, these built in functions don't work on the type of data that you'd like to sort.  For example, if you'd like to sort a list of dictionaries each item in your list is a dictionary, so you need some way of comparing two dictionaries to determine which one is \"less\".  Now that you know that we can pass functions into other functions, we can use this to pass a comparison function into quicksort to be used for these purposes.\n",
