    "# 1. Complexity and Energy Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll be exploring the relationship between computational complexity - the efficiency of the programs we write - and the energy consumption our programs use.  An important initial caveat - the calculations we'll be doing here are really \"back of the envelope\" style calculations.  They're an estimate, and may actually be far from the real values, but hopefully they'll give us a sense of how computational complexity relates to energy consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few initial reminders / things to know for the less physics savvy among us:\n",
    "* Watts (W) - watts are a measure of *power* and they meausre Joules per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Watt Hours (Wh) - watt-hours are a measure of *energy* consumption and they measure watts used in an hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that we'll be converting from seconds used to energy consumption (watt hours).  Computational complexity is more often measured *not* based on seconds, since the seconds used can vary from computer to computer, but based on *computation steps* used.  If we were going to convert that to energy consumption, we'd first need to determine the performance per watt (number of computation steps per watt) that our computer could perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start off by setting up a few global variables with set values that will be useful in this lab.  We usually put these global variables at the top of a library and name them in all caps to make it clear that the values don't vary."
