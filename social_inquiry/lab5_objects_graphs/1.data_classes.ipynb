Determine what type (float, string, etc) each result is.  Think about what interesting information you might be able to extract from this data once you have it, and make sure you ask questions that will allow you to determine something you find interesting.  Record the questions / features you plan to ask here along with a short explanation of why you chose these questions and this data representation (string, float, etc.). **"
